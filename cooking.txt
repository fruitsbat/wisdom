love italian ,
I am a HUGE fan of PF Changs' Chicken Noodle Soup! But because I am a vegan, I thought I would have to give it up forever. Today, however, I used your copycat recipe and made it vegan. It was FABULOUS! 
I found this recipe for PF Changs Chicken Noodel Soup - which I Love!
I made it this week adn it is pretty right on.
I am copying the exact recipe below but here are my suggestions/modifications based on the soup I made: use less soy or low sodium, soup was a little salty for my liking.
I did a pretty long squirt of siracha - (2 TBSp) and it was pretty spicy but we like that added chopped green onions when i added the tomatoes added noodles directly to the soup after the 15 min simmer.
I was unable to find the noodles they use at Chang's and used bahn pho rice sticks instead.

I exchanged the chicken broth for Imagine's Organic No-Chicken broth and I used thinly sliced Beyond Meat's [grilled] Chicken-Free Strips for the chicken breasts. 
I am in heaven! 
I made this & it turned out spot on. I added bean sprouts & it gaved it a nice crunch. Thank you for the receipe.
Noodle are pin rice noodles 
Question on Udon noodles? Do I use the whole pack? Does not look like the noodles that PF Changs uses.

I have not seen the Marie or Morning Coffee type in the US except at the PBX on an armed forces base!
They have all sorts of European food!
This was really popular when we were young as it was one thing we were allowed to make as it did not involve anything electric or hot!
I believe the British were the first to make it - came to that assumption because of the British Biscuits used but if anyone knows the origin...please let me know! 
Melt the chocolate ( I use the microwave, checking it and stirring it until it melts. You can also use a double boiler )
Beat the butter with the caster sugar until light and creamy.
Beat the butter with the caster sugar until light and creamy.
Beat in the melted chocolate and then the eggs, one at a time.
Dip the biscuits into the coffee
Use a largish dish that isn't too shallow make layers of coffee-moistened biscuits alternating with layers of the chocolate cream.
Refrigerate for at least 24 hours.
If you really want to be decadent, top with some fresh whipped cream!
Grate some chocolate curls on top.
Scouse Recipe
Scouse was brought to Liverpool by Northern European sailors, it was originally called Labskause or lobskause.
This was finally shortened to Skause and over time the spelling changed to the more Anglicised version we know and love today, Scouse.
Interesting Note: The Danish name is "skipper labskovs". In Swedish, it's "kallops".
The people who ate Scouse were all generally sailors and their families and eventually all sailors within Liverpool were referred to as Scousers. Time has now taken its toll and everyone from the region of Liverpool and its surroundings are known as a Scousers.
Scouse holds a special place in the hearts of us Liverpudlian's it's the defining taste of my hometown and is still regulary eaten today by a great number of families, including my own.
I've seen some extremely odd recipes online - adding tomatoes for example (this is a HUGE NO-NO) or garlic or other unneeded ingredients. A lot of recipes add beef as well as lamb OR JUST beef, some recipes say you serve it soupy, or like a hot-pot done on the stove, but I personally think it should be mushy and filling. I will show you how to make a classic version here.
Scouse rivals even the chicken soup and hot lemon & honey cures of my, now distant, childhood when it comes to cold hands and feet and runny winter noses.
Enjoy this good hearty winter warming stew, guaranteed to get you glowing when it is cold and damp!
Scouse is a simple stew which is cheap, cheerful and very very TASTY. 
2 Tblsp vegetable oil
2lb of Lamb breast
2 large onions
4 large carrots
3lb potatoes
2 or 3 stock cubes (Oxo cubes) or 3 to 4 cups of beef stock
Worcester sauce to taste
Salt and pepper to season
Water to cover
This takes 4 hours of slow cooking but is worth it! Or you can cook in the oven for 4 hours at 160ÂºC/325ÂºF/gas or moderate heat. Alternatively use a slow cooker and cook for 10 hours.
Cut the meat into large cubes and fry in the vegatable oil until browned all over. You can add some Worcester Sauce at this point for added flavour if you wish.
Transfer the meat into a large saucepan and add the onion that should be chopped into large chunks. Follow this by chopping the carrot into medallions and place this on the meat. Peel and then cube into 1 inch squares 1lb of the potatoes and place on top of the carrots.
Fill the pan with cold water until it is half full. Crush up the Oxo cubes into powder and sprinkle into the water. Add salt and pepper for seasoning.
Let the pan simmer very gently, stirring occasionally. The large pieces of onion will start to break up and the potato will become soft, this will make the final sauce thick.
Simmer gently for a total of two hours, then add the remaining potatoes that should have been peeled and roughly chopped and left chunky, add a few more splashes of Worcester Sauce to taste. Then simmer, again gently, for another two hours.
Check for seasoning to taste (Worcester sauce,salt, pepper)
Serve the Scouse piping hot lightly sprinkled with fresh parsley or coriander, with pickled red cabbage, pickled onions and fresh baked crusty bread.
You can eat this with Tomato sauce or HP sauce if so desired but it is so good on its own it doesn't need anything else.

2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup ketchup
1 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons grape jelly (Optional)
1 teaspoon minced garlic
Directions
This Crock Pot Coca Cola Pork Chop recipe is real easy and real good! This makes a great main dish and if your family likes pork chops they will love this recipe.
Brown chops in skillet on top of the stove. Place in crock pot. Whisk together the coke, brown sugar, black pepper, salt, ketchup, chopped onion, jelly and minced garlic with a wire whisk. Pour over chops. Cook 7 to 8 hours on low or 4 to 5 hours on high. Serve chops with the gravy poured over them. Makes 4 to 6 servings. Enjoy!
Note: These chops are so tender they just fall apart. You could double or triple this recipe and pour over just about any pork roast or ribs. I like to serve them over my fried cornbread recipe or mashed potatoes.

PAN YEAST ROLLS Recipe
These rolls are easy to make and family and friends will love them. 
cup instant grits uncooked
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon salt
3 cups hot water
1/3 cup vegetable oil (I use canola oil)
6 to 6 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Combine instant grits, sugar, and salt in large bowl.
Add water, oil and 2 cups of the flour.
Beat 2 minutes on low speed with mixer.
Add 1 cup additional flour and yeast.
Beat 1 minute on low speed.
Stir in additional flour to make soft dough.
Turn out on floured board and knead until smooth and elastic. Add additional flour if needed.
Spray two round cake pans and divide dough in half.
Shape each half into 18 balls and place in pans.
Cover and let rise 1 to 2 hours until doubled in size.

THE Bacardi Rum Cake.....adjusted for today's box cake mixes Recipe
Several years ago Bacardi’s Rum Cake recipe used an 18 ½ ounce cake mix and box of instant vanilla pudding mix. Not long after that box cake mixes were developed with “pudding in the mix” which now are known as “super moist” or “deliciously moist.” They also down-sized weights from 18 ½ ounces to today’s Betty Crocker 15 1/4 ounces and Duncan Hine’s 16.5 ounces (don’t you just hate when they do that?) Bacardi has adapted its recipe for rum cake so that instant pudding is no longer required but if you use a “moist” cake mix today other ingredient adjustments are needed. Here is the recipe with these adaptations. Make this divine cake for your special holiday occasions!
CAKE:
1 cup chopped pecans (or walnuts)
1 yellow cake mix "moist-type" (15.25 oz to 16 oz.)
3 eggs
1/2 cup cold water
1/3 cup Wesson oil (I used canola)
1/2 cup Bacardi dark rum (80 proof)
GLAZE:
1/4 pound butter (1 stick)
1/4 cup water
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup Bacardi dark rum (80 proof)
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and flour a 10" tube or 12" Bundt pan. Sprinkle nuts over bottom of pan.
In large mixing bowl combine cake mix, eggs, 1/2 cup cold water, oil, and 1/2 cup rum. Mix well.
Pour into prepared pan over nuts. Bake about 55 minutes until golden brown and the middle tests done with wooden toothpick.
Cool in pan on wire rack 10 minutes and prepare glaze while it's cooling (recipe below.) After cake has cooled slightly invert it onto dinner plate or serving dish (it needs to be slightly larger than cake and with a rim to hold in syrup glaze as it's poured.) Then prick caketop all over with toothpick. Spoon or drizzle glaze evenly over top and sides (I use a turkey baster afterwards to reach all surfaces and return pooled glaze to coat cake all over - see Photo 2.) At first the hot syrup will pool in middle and at bottom edges but as it cools the syrup gets thicker and if you keep spooning or basting it back up to top, eventually all the syrup will absorb into cake.
GLAZE:
Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat; add 1/4 cup water, and sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat as needed to boil gently for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Stir in rum.
Optionally decorate border with sugar frosting or whipped cream
I was going to look for a recipe, and here it is.
Sex in a Pan Recipe
This rich, sweet, sinful, delicious dessert is not called "Sex in a pan" for nothing. You decide. LOL Great for any occasion. One of my favourite desserts. Yummy! 
BASE:
1 cup all-purpose flour (250 ml)
1/2 cup (125 ml) butter
2 tbsp (30 ml) sugar
1/4 cup (60 ml) chopped nuts
CREAM CHEESE FILLING:
8 ozs (250 ml) cream cheese
2/3 cup (150 ml) icing sugar
1 cup (250 ml) Cool Whip
PUDDING MIX TOPPING:
2 1/2 cups (625 ml) milk
2 - 3 1/2 ozs instant pudding mix (vanilla or chocolate or flavour of your choice)
1 cup (250 ml) Cool Whip
Garnish (coconut, nuts, marashino cherries, chocolate curls, etc...)
To prepare the base, combine flour, butter, sugar and nuts.
Mix until crumbly. Press into greased 10" spring form pan or square pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. Let cool.
In the meantime, prepare the cream cheese filling by beating the cream cheese with the icing sugar. Fold in 1 cup of cool whip until well blended. Spread over the cooled crust. Refrigerate while making the topping.
To prepare the pudding mix topping, add the milk to the instant pudding mix following the directions on the package. Let cool. Top with remaining cool whip. Garnish with coconut, chopped nuts, shaved chocolate or marashino cherries, strawberries. Refrigerate before serving. Yields about 12 to 16 servings.
Ugh! Too many unnatural chemicals! 
wwas great
Sex In A Bowl Recipe
1 x Chocolate cake (any boxed)
2 pkt Chocolate Mousse (by Jello)
6 x Bars SKOR Bars
3 ounce Kahlua
1 lrg container Cold Whip
Bake chocolate cake and cold. Mix up chocolate mouuse according to directions on package. Let set to harden. Crush SKOR bars bars and set aside.
Let the cake set to cold. Then pour Kahlua over the top and allow to seep into cake and then crumble cake. Split all items into thirds and then layer cake, mousse, whip cream, SKOR bars.
cherries and orange slices compliments of me- cause what is sex on the beach without a cherry and the orange just helps decorate ;)
3 ounces orange juice (I buy Simply Orange pulp free)
3 ounces cranberry juice cocktail
1 ounce vodka (we use Sky Vodka)
1 ounce peach schnapps
**disclaimer: No, I am not a lush. I just enjoy a good boozy drink once in a while. Ok, well, more than once in a while....but it doesn't make me a lush. Does it? ;)
No, not the real thing.....do you really think I would tell you about that? 
lol But I really have to say that I do enjoy a good glass (or 2, maybe 3) of Sex on the Beach whenever I can!
I also have to agree with one of my fans (Erin - you are so funny) that the drink is way better than the act. 
Really, who wants all that gritty sand covering them? (is Donna jumping up and down somewhere in bloggy land raising her hand high? lol) If you ask me, that is way too distracting. ;o)
It's no wonder I love this drink. 
To say I love peaches is an understatement. 
Getting a good peach however, now that is not an easy thing to always do. 
However, with this drink, the only "peach" you need here is the peach schnapps and that stuff my friends is never bad. Trust me!
Grumpy wasn't so sure he wanted this drink. 
He had his heart set on a Peach Mojito, but alas, the only grocery store we have in town did not have any mint. So, Grumpy had to settle for some Sex on the Beach. Once he had one, he was ready for another! 
The drink is slightly sweet, not sickly sweet. They also go down pretty darn easy, so be careful consuming these!
So, grab your significant other and make yourselves a few of these babies. Maybe by the time your done, you won't care if your covered in sand!
Mix, stir, pour, enjoy!
Let me say right up front - fruitcake gets a bad rap.
My theory is that many object to the darker types, with lots of spice and molasses.
Or the sheer size or amount of this rich cake is enough to last folks til next Christmas
You will be pleasantly surprised though with Mrs. Harvey’s White Fruitcake.
In the ’50s, Lucile Harvey submitted a recipe to The Tampa Tribune for a fruitcake – she won $5 and second place!
But for the next several years, the newspaper got so many requests that they finally reprinted it – and the popularity of that recipe continues to grow ~ so much that the recipe is now reprinted in the Trib each year right after Thanksgiving, and HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST 60 YEARS.
Mrs Harvey died in the mid ’80s, but her fruitcake recipe lives on as her memorial. Compare this to other fruitcake recipes and you’ll see why it’s so special.
Pecans, candied cherries and candied pineapple - but no mixed candied citron.
That’s for starters. Then there’s no spice at all; instead are the refreshing flavors of vanilla extract and lemon extract.
To be correct, with the butter and eggs, this is actually a blonde not white fruitcake.
Regardless of color, most everyone I’ve shared it with loves it.
To be on the safe side I usually gift fruitcakes in petite or small sizes.
That way, no one can say “too much fruitcake!”
With Mrs. Harvey’s, in my opinion, there’s no such thing as too much!
4 cups shelled pecans (approx. 1 lb.)
8 ounces candied cherries (original recipe had 1 lb. but I took the liberty to reduce the ratio to half that of candied pineapple; I just liked it better - sorry, Mrs. Harvey!)
1 pound candied pineapple
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 pound butter
1 cup sugar
5 large eggs
1/2 to 2 ounces vanilla extract (1 to 4 tablespoons is quite a range for flavorings, but it is all personal preference. I used 2 tablespoons each of vanilla and lemon and it was just fine.)
1/2 to 2 ounces lemon extract (see note above)
There are endless possibilities for pans or tins to bake fruitcake. You can use one 10-inch tube pan or large fruitcake tin for the whole recipe; 2 or 3 medium loaf pans; 6 or 7 mini loaf pans 5 1/2 x 3 1/2, or 18 to 24 petite loaf pans 4" x 2 1/2, depending on desired fill amount.
Whichever you choose, it is best to line them with parchment paper, clean brown paper bag paper cut to size, foil, or for smaller loaf sizes, commercial paper liners. I don't find the need to grease them or spray. The liner helps them release from pan without tearing, and protects fruits and nuts.
Chop nuts and fruit into medium-size pieces (see photo for approximate size). Dredge with 1/4 cup of the flour (see photo); set aside.
Beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, vanilla and lemon extracts.
Stir together remaining 1 1/2 cups flour and baking powder in medium bowl; fold into butter-egg mixture. Using strong wooden spoon, blend in fruit and nuts (batter will be stiff.)
Push batter into prepared pan(s).
Place in cold oven and turn the oven to 250 degrees.
When done, the fruit cake will be golden and firm on top with no wetness, and golden brown on sides and bottom (see photos).
Remove from oven; cool in pans on cake rack. Remove wrappers or liners if desired and re-wrap in plastic wrap or foil. (Batter has a lot of butter so liners might be greasy.)
Approximate baking time:
FOR 10-INCH TUBE PANS OR LARGE FRUIT CAKE TIN: Bake 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Check cake 1 hour before earliest done time and again 30 minutes before to make sure it doesnât over bake.
FOR MEDIUM LOAF PAN SIZES: 1 3/4 to 2 hours; check one half hour before earliest time to make sure it doesnât over bake.
MINI LOAF PANS: About 1 to 1 1/4 hours total; check after 50 minutes.
PETITE LOAF PANS: About 45 - 50 minutes total; check after 35 minutes.
Yield: 4 1/2 pounds of fruitcake, or 24 servings (3-ounce generous slice size.)
